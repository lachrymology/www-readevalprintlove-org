One day the macrolyte approach the master macrologist
Pi Mu (Π無) and put forth a question:

*Master, which Lisp is the greatest of all Lisps?*

Pi Mu looked at the macrolyte and, in a low tone, told him 
to meet him in the garden after the day's work was done and he would tell him the answer.

At the end of the day the macrolyte did as Pi Mu instructed 
and met him at the entry way to the humble garden.  He 
immediately posed his question again:

*Master, which Lisp is the greatest of all Lisps?*

In a careful way Pi Mu then pointed at a patch of nearby sakura and said:

*Look here at this patch of sakura.*

*What a tall one that one.*
 
*What a short one that one.*

The student was at once enlightened.
