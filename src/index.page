One day the macrolyte approach the master macrologist
Pi Mu (Π無) and put forth a question:

> Master, which Lisp is the greatest of all Lisps?

Pi Mu looked at the macrolyte and, in a low tone, told him 
to meet him in the garden after the day's work was done and he would tell him the answer.

At the end of the day the macrolyte did as Pi Mu instructed 
and met him at the entry way to the humble garden.  He 
immediately posed his question again:

> Master, which Lisp is the greatest of all Lisps?

In a careful manner Pi Mu then pointed at a patch of nearby sakura and said:

> Look here at this patch of sakura.
>
> What a tall one that one.
>
> What a short one that one.

The student was at once enlightened.

--- name:study-intro

Every issue of Read-Eval-Print-λove will offer recommendations for study.  The *study* section will usually contain an anchoring theme for the issue, but will sometimes be something else entirely.

--- name:study

 * Multitude of lisps
 * German school
 * Simoni
 * Dipert Lisp

--- name:practice-intro

I'll usually include a practice problem for solving, sometimes related to the overall theme and sometimes not.  These will not always be programming puzzles and the like.

--- name:practice

 * Some other abstraction for Simoni's object tags?
 * Tearing things further? (anything)
 
--- name:realization-intro

From time to time I'll try to deconstruct a piece of code, blog post, book or presentation.

--- name:realization

 * GLOS?

--- name:play-intro

Play is fun and fun is good.

--- name:play

 * 32 lines?
