BACKGROUND: Some reading along may not be aware that poor Clyde the
elephant is the canonical exemplar used in AI literature for discussing
problems in inheritance.  The standard example is that all mammals have 
4 legs, and then to go sawing off one of Clyde's appendages and to start
to ask whether Clyde is therefore not an elephant.  This usually leads
to a discussion about whether negative inheritance is possible, and 
whether Clyde really has 4 legs but that one of them is of type 
MISSING-LEG (which helps a lot, actually, since you can then still discuss
the color of his missing leg, etc.), or whether he has just three legs
(which brings into question the notion that what it means to be "of a class"
is to have all the properties of the class, and to ask the implicit question:
"is there anything you can then depend on if exceptions are allowed?").
