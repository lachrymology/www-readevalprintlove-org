BACKGROUND: Some reading along may not be aware that poor Clyde the
elephant is the canonical exemplar used in AI literature for discussing
problems in inheritance.  The standard example is that all mammals have 
4 legs, and then to go sawing off one of Clyde's appendages and to start
to ask whether Clyde is therefore not an elephant.  This usually leads
to a discussion about whether negative inheritance is possible, and 
whether Clyde really has 4 legs but that one of them is of type 
MISSING-LEG (which helps a lot, actually, since you can then still discuss
the color of his missing leg, etc.), or whether he has just three legs
(which brings into question the notion that what it means to be "of a class"
is to have all the properties of the class, and to ask the implicit question:
"is there anything you can then depend on if exceptions are allowed?").

--- name:study-intro

Every issue of Read-Eval-Print-λove will offer recommendations for study.  The *study* section will usually contain an anchoring theme for the issue, but will sometimes be something else entirely.

--- name:study

TODO

--- name:practice-intro

I'll usually include a practice problem for solving, sometimes related to the overall theme and sometimes not.  These will not always be programming puzzles and the like.

--- name:practice

TODO

--- name:realization-intro

From time to time I'll try to deconstruct a piece of code, blog post, book or presentation.

  * A language that cannot host its own evolution is not worth using

--- name:play-intro

Play is fun and fun is good.  This section will usually contain odd-ball functions, macros or even code examples in non-Lisp languages.  All bets are off here.

 * How can you tell that you're the only programmer in a group of "architects"?  You're the only person who leaves without a pile of business cards.
   - Store about that thing.
   - Tie to RPG's talk
