<p>Read-Eval-Print-λove is a bi-monthly newsletter of original content and curation about the Lisp family of programming languages and little-languages.</p>

<p>Every issue of Read-Eval-Print-λove will be made available through this site and mailing list for FREE, but I'm also exploring optional payment offerings through <a href="https://leanpub.com/readevalprintlove001">LeanPub</a>. This payment option would be "pay what you wish, with a small minimum" and is intended to offer alternate formats and updates only (i.e. epub, mobi, PDF). The content on this site/list and on Leanpub will be exactly the same.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy. :F</p>
