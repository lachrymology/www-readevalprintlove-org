2012 Feb 23 - Clojure 1.3.0, sheet v1.3

Added new section Destructuring, with a link to a page containing
examples on clojure.org, and a list of the most commonly-used macros
that allow destructuring to be used within them.

Added biginteger, clojure.java.io/file and copy, and link to fs
project on GitHub for file manipulation functions.

Removed "Others" part of Metadata section.  It contained too many
rarely-used metadata keys that can better be described on the
clojure.org/special_forms web page linked to.

Added more links to clojure.org, mostly in section titles.

Moved take-last from subcategory Head-items to Tail-items in Seq
in/Seq out section.

Moved Zippers/Get zipper functions to Zippers/Create.

Fix link to ->> in LaTeX so it works in generated PDF files.

Many small tweaks to try to get it to almost fit in 2 pages with both
US letter and A4 page sizes, but I think I'm giving up on that.  It is
2+ sheets on paper, with room to grow.  I used several more
occurrences of common {pre, suf}fixes to try to get it down, and left
those in.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2012 Feb 17 - Clojure 1.3.0, sheet v1.2

Added / after all namespace symbols, plus a brief note about this
notation, to be clearer to those new to Clojure.

Improved formatting of some code snippets in Abstractions section.

Made URL to clojure.org clickable, and added a few more of them.

Fixed several typos: with-in-string -> with-in-str, Print/to string
changed to IO/to string.

Removed function sequence, which is rarely if ever used.  seq is far
more common and useful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2012 Feb 16 - Clojure 1.3.0, sheet v1.1

Primitives/Strings: Restructured to remove split between functions in
clojure.core vs. clojure.string, added Regex functions (moved from
where they used to be, way at the end in Other/Regex).

Collections: Added examples of abbreviations like (my-vec idx) -> (nth
my-vec idx), for vectors, maps, and sets.  Combined subsections Sets
and Sets (clojure.set).

Removed StructMaps.

Printing: Renamed IO, and significantly expanded its content.  Moved
what was in Other/IO here.  I put in links to some Java 6 docs and a
couple of binary I/O Clojure libraries on github.  That might be going
overboard.

Multimethods: Renamed Abstractions, like in Fogus's ClojureScript
cheatsheet, and pretty much copied what he had there (adjusting for
slight ClojureScript and Clojure/JVM differences I know about, like
. instead of .-)

Reader Macros: Removed obsolete ^form -> (meta form).  Changed #^ to ^

Metadata: Added new section with some details on metadata.

Special Forms: No content changes, simply moved earlier to try to make
things pack a little better in PDF version, which is just barely over
2 page now.

2012 Feb 15 - Clojure 1.3.0, sheet v1.0

Minor clojure-cheatsheet-generator.clj script updates so it would run
without errors or warnings with Clojure 1.3.0.

Removals:

replicate, because DEPRECATED.
throw-if since it is declared private in clojure.core.  It was in 1.2
as well, but does it really belong in the cheatsheet?


Additions of things new in Clojure 1.3.0:

find-keyword to Other/Keywords
realized? to Using a Seq/Check for forced evaluation
every-pred and some-fn to Functions/Create
with-redefs and with-redefs-fn to Macros/Scope
clojure.repl/pst to Java Interoperation/Exceptions
unchecked-{add,dec,divide,inc,multiply,negate,remainder,subtract}-int to Numbers/Unchecked.  Space is a bit tight in that column to also include the long versions.
nthrest to Seq in, Seq out/Tail-items
clojure.data/diff to Misc/Compare
clojure.java.javadoc/javadoc to Documentation/clojure.repl (I know, it is not really in clojure.repl -- space is getting tight in that column)
clojure.pprint/pprint and print-table to Printing/Print to *out*


Additions of things that existed before Clojure 1.3.0:

compare to several places that seem appropriate:
    Seq in, Seq out/Rearrange, after sort-by
    Numbers/Compare
    Strings/Use
    Misc/Compare
flatten to Seq in, Seq out/'Change'
fnil to Functions/Create
instance? to Misc/Test


Moved:

doc and find-doc to Documentation/clojure.repl, since they moved from
clojure.core in 1.2.x to clojure.repl in 1.3.0.

2011 Sep 05

Changes in cheatsheet version 2.0 from the cheatsheet version
published at http://clojure.org/cheatsheet as of Sep 5, 2011:

Additions:

Collections/Sets: sorted-set-by
Macros/Branch: case

Removals:

Removed contains? from Collections/Collections/Content tests, but
remains in Collections/Maps.  Its appearance in the former category is
potentially misleading as to its behavior.  Suggested by Stuart
Sierra.

Removed Transients/Change and Transients/Iteration categories, since
those functions did not work on transients.  All of the functions that
were there also appear elsewhere in more appropriate categories of the
cheatsheet.  Renamed Transients/Use to Transients/Change.

Removed nthrest and rfirst, which had no links to any documentation.
I believe they existed in a version of Clojure before 1.2, but were
removed by version 1.2 or earlier.

Minor:

HTML uses < > = ! instead of codes like %3C %3E etc.

Some reordering of lists of functions referring to types like byte,
short, int, long.
