<p>One day the macrolyte approach the master macrologist
Pi Mu (Π無) and put forth a question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Master, which Lisp is the greatest of all Lisps?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pi Mu looked at the macrolyte and, in a low tone, told him 
to meet him in the garden after the day&#8217;s work was done and he would tell him the answer.</p>

<p>After a long day&#8217;s toil[^toil the macrolyte did as Pi Mu instructed 
and met him at the entry way to the humble garden.  He 
immediately posed his question again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Master, which Lisp is the greatest of all Lisps?</p>

<p>In a careful manner Pi Mu then pointed at a patch of nearby sakura and said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look here at this patch of sakura.</p>

<h1 id="whats-lisp">What&#8217;s Lisp?</h1>

<p>In 1980 John McCarthy wrote a paper entitled <em><a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/lisp20th.html">LISP - Notes on its past and future</a></em> for Stanford&#8217;s Lisp conference that year.  With in the paper he listed fifteen points that he claimed characterized LISP:</p>

<p>As a programming language, LISP is characterized by the following ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Computing with symbolic expressions rather than numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representation of symbolic expressions and other information by
list structure in computer memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representation of information on paper, from keyboards and in
other external media mostly by multi-level lists and sometimes by
S-expressions. It has been important that any kind of data can be 
represented by a single general type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A small set of selector and constructor operations expressed as
functions, i.e. car, cdr and cons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Composition of functions as a tool for forming more complex
functions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of conditional expressions for getting branching into
function definitions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recursive use of conditional expressions as a sufficient tool
for building computable functions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of λ-expressions for naming functions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The storage of information on the property lists of atoms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The representation of LISP programs as LISP data that can be
manipulated by object programs. This has prevented the separation
between system programmers and application programmers. Everyone
can <code>improve'' his LISP, and many of these</code>improvements&#8217;&#8217; have
developed into improvements to the language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conditional expression interpretation of Boolean connectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The LISP function eval that serves both as a formal definition of
the language and as an interpreter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Garbage collection as the means of erasure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minimal requirements for declarations so that LISP statements can
be executed in an on-line environment without preliminaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LISP statements as a command language in an on-line environment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Under these conditions<sup id="fnref:define"><a href="#fn:define" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, what current languages are Lisps?  Which fall short?  Some related reading:</p>

<p>Is Lisp a Platonic ideal?</p>

<h1 id="the-german-school-of-lisp">The German School of Lisp</h1>

<p><em>This is an expanded and updated version of an <a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/05/03/the-german-school-of-lisp-2/">earlier article on Fluchtpunkt Lisps from 2011</a>.</em></p>

<p>The German school of Lisp is described by <a href="http://kazimirmajorinc.blogspot.com/2011/04/one-picolisp-snippet.html">Kazimir Majorinc</a> as a Spartan movement<sup id="fnref:mini"><a href="#fn:mini" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> in Lisp implementation.  But let me be clear, the Lisps in question are not toys like the one&#8217;s littering the Lisp landscape (including my own: <a href="http://github.com/fogus/lithp">Lithp</a> and <a href="http://github.com/fogus/ulithp">μLithp</a>). Likewise, these Lisps are not libraries nor are they full-blown development ecosystems.  </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s explore these distinctions for just a moment to clarify my meaning.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.fogus.me/blog/lisps.png" alt="Lisps" title="The space between" /></p>

<p>This post deals with that crimson space between, but first&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="exo-lisps">Exo-Lisps</h2>

<p>Exo-Lisps are the variants that exist to serve very pointed use cases.  They can take the form of highly specialized libraries or embeddables like <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ref-dyn-patterns.html">GLOS</a> or <a href="http://lush.sourceforge.net/">Lush</a>.  Likewise, Exo-Lisps may facilitate embedding within applications or act as extension frameworks like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/guile/">Guile</a>, <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=770237">Visual Lisp</a>, <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/elk/">Elk</a>, and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/">Emacs Lisp</a>.  Finally, Exo-Lisps like <a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe">LFE</a> and <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2363">Liskell</a> serve as skins over the semantics of another language.</p>

<h2 id="practical-lisps">Practical Lisps</h2>

<p>Practicality is a relative term.  Having said that, there are clearly a set of Lisps that exist primarily to solve &#8220;real world&#8221; problems, including: <a href="http://common-lisp.net/">Common Lisp</a>, <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>, <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme (R5RS, R6RS, R7RS-big)</a>, <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a>, and <a href="http://www.opendylan.org/">Dylan</a>.  I&#8217;m tempting libel cases by including this particular category and filling it with these particular choices, but so be it.</p>

<h2 id="kernel-lisps">Kernel Lisps</h2>

<p>I struggled to find a way of separating Exo-Lisps and Kernel Lisps and the following distinction from this struggle arose.  Where Exo-Lisps serve as a framework for a specific problem, Kernel Lisps serve as a framework for a more general problem  &#8211; language development and experimentation.  Perhaps I&#8217;m splitting hairs.  Some examples of Kernel Lisps include: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.scheme/MCfPoeir90s">R7RS-small</a>, <a href="http://s48.org">Scheme48</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machine_Lisp">Lisp Machine Lisp</a>, <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/masjap/EuLisp/eulisp.html">EuLisp</a>, and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/">Kawa</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pedagogical-lisps">Pedagogical Lisps</h2>

<p>As I alluded to earlier, the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=toy+lisp">Lisp landscape is rife with toys</a>, <a href="http://axisofeval.blogspot.com/2010/08/no-more-minimal-early-lisps-pulleezz.html">Ur-Lisps</a>, and half implementations.  However, the vast majority of these Lisps exist for pedagogical pursuits and are rarely (if ever) overtly practical<sup id="fnref:overt"><a href="#fn:overt" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="fluchtpunkt-lisps">Fluchtpunkt Lisps</h2>

<p>Fluchtpunkt Lisps skirt the vanishing point between theory, practicality, and art.  These implementations are all of the other categories in some way, while simultaneously being none in particular.  They may or may not be general purpose languages in all instances, but they are all driven by a fervent ideal.  </p>

<p>Below is a list of Fluchtpunkt Lisp implementations that I&#8217;ve found, and some discussion of their driving ideal (as I understand):</p>

<h4 id="thttpmumblenetjartproject"><a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/tproject/">T</a></h4>

<p>T is my favorite Scheme variant and the inspiration for many a Lisp thereafter.  I&#8217;ve poured over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/013881905X?tag=fogus-20">Stephen Slade&#8217;s T book</a> numerous times, finding something mind blowing each time.  The primary driving force behind T was to prove that a Scheme could be made to run extremely fast, and fast it ran.  T&#8217;s compiler technology was the motivation for numerous dissertations, and remains influential in many ways, even if some of its compilation techniques have fallen out of fashion.  The names attached to T development is an all-star roster of langdev<sup id="fnref:langdev"><a href="#fn:langdev" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> including, but not limited to: <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/">Kent Pitman</a>, <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/">Jonathan Rees</a>, <a href="http://mumble.net/~kelsey/">Richard Kelsey</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/people/hudak.html">Paul Hudak</a> and <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/">Olin Shivers</a>.</p>

<h4 id="shenhttpshenlanguageorg"><a href="http://shenlanguage.org/">Shen</a></h4>

<p>Shen (and its predeccesor Qi) really pushes the limits of what we might call a Fluchtpunkt Lisp.  I suspect it requires a categorization of its own.  </p>

<p>A few years ago I was looking for a Lisp to dive into and my searching uncovered two extremely interesting options: Clojure and Qi.  I eventually went with Clojure, but in the intervening time I&#8217;ve managed to spend quality time with Qi and I love what I&#8217;ve seen so far.  Qi&#8217;s confluence of features, including an optional type system (actually, its type system might be more accurately classified as &#8220;skinnable&#8221;), pattern matching,<sup id="fnref:patt"><a href="#fn:patt" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and an embedded logic engine based on Prolog, make it a very compelling choice indeed.</p>

<p>Aside from the type system and the embedded Prolog Shen also supports function definition as successive pattern matching forms.  Below you&#8217;ll see an implementation of the </p>

<h4 id="newlisphttpwwwnewlisporg"><a href="http://www.newlisp.org/">newLISP</a></h4>

<p>newLISP raised some ire at one point or another because of its design choices, specifically its choice of pervasive dynamic scope and <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-090110-124904/unrestricted/jshutt.pdf">fexprs</a> (pdf).<sup id="fnref:fexprs"><a href="#fn:fexprs" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>  I like dynamic scope under some circumstances, but I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve followed it to its logical end for any application of significant size or complexity.  The advocates of newLISP are interesting folk and in many ways of my own mind.  For example, how would one <a href="index.html">calculate Pi out to <code>n</code> digits in newLISP</a>?</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp"><code>(define (pi n)
  (replace "\\" 
(join                                        &lt;1&gt;
      (exec                                      &lt;2&gt;
        (format 
          "echo 'scale=%d; 4 * a(1)' | bc -ql"   &lt;3&gt;
          n)))
    ""))

(pi 30) 
;;=&gt; "3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841968"
</code></pre>

<ol>
  <li>Wait for the result from a child process</li>
  <li>Spawn a child process</li>
  <li>Build the UNIX command as a string</li>
</ol>

<p>Why you would call out to the UNIX <code>bc</code> command of course.</p>

<p>Why would you need your programming language to provide that type of calculation<sup id="fnref:mul"><a href="#fn:mul" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> when there are more appropriate tools for doing so?  This is a question asked, and aswered by newLISP. </p>

<p>I suppose the fundamental philosophy of newLISP is to not necessarily provide everything, but to make everything possible.  newLISP facilitates possibility by treating the use of <code>eval</code> as a first-class approach and utterly idiomatic.</p>

<h4 id="archttpwwwpaulgrahamcomarchtml"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a></h4>

<p>I agonized over including Paul Graham&#8217;s Arc in the category of Fluchtpunkt Lisp, but I think this is the correct place for it.  The driving forces behind Arc are <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">succinctness</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">centenarianism</a> &#8211; both of which are certainly emblematic of the Fluchtpunkt ideal.  Arc hasn&#8217;t taken off <a href="http://www.arclanguage.org/item?id=8462">as much as non-Paul-Graham humans would have liked</a>, but I believe that the root of the problem is that they prayed for practical, but instead got Fluchtpunkt.  In general, the development pace of Paul Graham is slow and generally tied directly to changes required to keep Hacker News running, but a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arclanguagewiki/home">community of Arc fanatics</a> has taken the torch and created various implementations and references for Arc.</p>

<h4 id="picolisphttpwwwpicolispcom"><a href="http://www.picolisp.com/">PicoLisp</a></h4>

<p>I first came across PicoLisp when reading the paper <a href="http://software-lab.de/radical.pdf">&#8220;Pico Lisp: A Radical Approach to Application Development&#8221;</a> by  Alexander Burger and was instantly fascinated.  The primary goal is to provide an idealized Lisp interpreter that runs as fast as possible.  To accomplish this goal PicoLisp limits its feature set and optimizes the code path along the dimensions of its features.  The core types provided by PicoLisp are numbers, symbols, and lists.  Given the paucity of these types PicoLisp has the advantage of always taking the most direct interpretation path and thus avoiding any unnecessary checks and abstractions that a more corpulent Lisp might require.  For example, PicoLisp&#8217;s <code>quote</code> function is defined in such a way that it <a href="http://picolisp.com/5000/!wiki?ArticleQuote">returns all of its arguments unevaluated</a> allowing the operation of <code>quote</code> to optimize into only a return of its <code>cdr</code> rather than the <code>car</code> of its <code>cdr</code>.  Simple no?</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect of PicoLisp is that is does not contain strings, arrays, vectors nor anything but exactly numbers, symbols and lists as first-class data types.  It&#8217;s drive for simplicity <sup id="fnref:simpl"><a href="#fn:simpl" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> in its offerings and possibilities as well as its implementation.  Aside from the practical matter that offering more data types means that there would be more type-specific functions, on the implementation side an increase in the  <a href="http://picolisp.com/5000/!wiki?ArrayAbstinence">number of tag-bits</a> is a limiting factor as well.  If you need a string, use a symbol.  If you need an array, use a list.  And so on&#8230;</p>

<p>Here is an example of some PicoLisp to scape a web-page:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp"><code>(load "@lib/http.l")
	 
(client "replove.herokuapp.com" 80 "sakura/index.html" &lt;1&gt;
  (when (from "Pi Mu ")                                &lt;2&gt;
    (pack (trim (till "and")))))                       &lt;3&gt;

;;=&gt; (Π無)
</code></pre>

<ol>
  <li>Attach to the page using the built-in client library</li>
  <li>Start reading bytes from a given string</li>
  <li>Stop reading when it finds a different string</li>
</ol>

<p>PicoLisp is, in my opinion, the most interesting entry in a family of <em>really really small Lisps</em> that also includes <a href="http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Nanolisp/">Nanolisp</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/femtolisp/">femtoLisp</a>, although I would hesitate to include these latter two in the Fluchtpunkt category. Even with its minimal data types, minimal scoping rules (dynamically scoped) and its favoring of <code>eval</code> over macros, PicoLisp still offers some interesting features like coroutines, first-class environments, and integrated database and Prolog (Pilog).</p>

<h4 id="wasp-lisphttpsitesgooglecomsitewaspvm"><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/waspvm/">Wasp Lisp</a></h4>

<p>Wasp Lisp is a small Scheme inspired by Erlang with lightweight cooperative threads, communication via channels, and an implementation of <a href="http://bc.tech.coop/blog/061119.html">MOSREF</a>.  This latter feature is fairly interesting in that it allows one to create a network of &#8220;drone&#8221; Wasp VMs that can receive secure snippets of code from a remote console for execution.  </p>

<p>Apple Computers once had a brilliant marketing campaign famously known as &#8220;Wheels for the mind.&#8221;  The image that went along with that phrase was as follows:</p>

<p><img src="images/wftm.jpg" alt="wheels" title="Wheels for the mind" /></p>

<p>This particular ad was run in 1981 and referred directly to the <a href="http://apple2history.org/">Apple II line of computers</a>.  However, even after that ad ran its course the company designed and developed amazing technologies that truly did serve as &#8220;wheels for the mind,&#8221; including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="ftp://ftp.informatimago.com/pub/lisp/macintosh-common-lisp-reference.pdf">Macintosh Common Lisp</a> (PDF) - a standards-compliant version of Common Lisp with powerful IDE</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568">Hypercard</a> - an early hypermedia development language and platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Dylan_programming_language">Dylan</a> - a Lisp-like object-oriented programming language originally designed as a <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/apple-newton.html">Newton</a> development system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these languages were ahead of their time and offered first-class development environments for the Apple line of computers and systems.  However, over time Apple eventually phased out each in every one of these languages and indeed the very computers that they targetted.  The early versions of the Apple II computers were software and hardware extensible and for many a young man or woman were truly &#8220;wheels for the mind.&#8221;  Sadly, had Apple simply phased out old hardware and development systems in favor of something new and more powerful then few would have shed a tear.  Instead, Apple moved away from the very notion of &#8220;wheels of the mind&#8221; in favor of building systems for consumers.  Objective C, the iPad and iCloud are no longer &#8220;wheels for the mind&#8221; but are instead simply &#8220;training wheels for the mind.&#8221;</p>
